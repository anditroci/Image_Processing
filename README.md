**Code name:** mnist_task.ipynb

**Description**: 

This task uses the Mnist dabase (LeCun et al., 2010) that collects images of hand written numbers from 0 to 9. The code aims to build a random forest model trained and tested on this data set. 


**Table of contents**:

1- Data exploration 

2- Definition of Train and Test split

3- Model fitting 

4- Model Evaluation 

5- Hyper parameter tuning

6- Confusion matrix assessment

7- Visualisation of samples and predicted values

8- Graph analysis of training and testing accuracy

**Installation requriements **: 

following libraries are required for this model: 

numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn
